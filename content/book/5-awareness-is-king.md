### It Starts as a Big Fog

January 1, 2017 my weight was 302 LBS.  My physical and emotional health were in tatters.  I had been working on weight loss for a long time.  Ups and downs.  Ups and downs.  Since 2012 I had been as high as 325 and as low as 270.  I had read many books and worked directly with many experts.  I had even started a weight loss business.  Yes I would lose weight, but the program would end, or my life situation would change, or a business would crash, and back would come the weight.  Always.

That day, January 1, 2017, I decided that rather than seek out other experts, that I would try  become the expert on me. I decided that I would listen to myself this time, to see if things would be different.  To see if I could find **lasting** change.  Change that is driven by pull rather than push.  Change that was driven by me.  Self-scribed change, not  prescribed change.

But it was all a big fog.  Even after all the help that I had received, programs that I had tried, and knowledge that I gained, I felt clueless.  Of course I knew the right kinds of food to eat.  I knew that keeping portions reasonable was important.  I knew that binge eating at night would lead to weight gain.  I knew that movement helps you feel better. I knew all of these things.  We all do.  But, how in the hell could I incorporate these into my life in an effective, enjoyable and lasting way?  Even more of a mystery, what was driving me to do things that I knew were bad for me. How could I find some semblance of control? 92% of us have not been able to figure these things out.  I had not been able to figure them out.  It was an abyss.

One of the most fateful decisions I made on that day was to start journaling my weight, eating and feelings every day.  I wanted to keep a record that might prove useful in the future.  I did not realize at the time that this practice would become the foundation of my successful weight loss efforts. It enabled me to begin clearing the fog.  This is called awareness.

### The Hidden Mind

The human brain is complicated. More complicated than the stock market, more complicated than that the physics of the universe.   At any given point in time, a staggering number of things are happening within our minds. We breath, our hearts beat, we make decisions, we drive without paying attention, we read the body language of others, we move, we decide, we love, we hate, and on and on.  How can we possibly manage all of these complicated, subtle, and interconnected processes?  The answer is, that for the most part we don’t. A great deal of this processing happens beyond our awareness, within our unconscious mind.  Some scientist believe as much as 95% of the brains activities happen unconsciously.  I will refer to this as the hidden mind.

Our hidden mind is continually gathering, processing, evaluating, and driving our behavior.  The conscious mind, the visible mind, applies logic.  Our hidden mind works on an entirely different plane, it is driven largely by emotions.  We have a sea of emotions laying underneath the surface.  Emotions that have been formed by past experiences.  Emotions that lead to automatic and sometimes irrational behaviors, such as destructive eating.

So what about that 5% of our thinking and processing that happens within our visible mind?  This is our awareness.  Awareness is like a lens, a spotlight, it focuses our conscious mind on those things that require our attention and consideration.

### Why Am I Eating?

Often, with problem eating, we shovel food into our mouths without noticing. In the past I have found myself gorging with only the faintest awareness that it was even happening.  What was driving that?  Taste?  I often don’t even recall tasting the food when shoveling it down.  Hunger?  If it were only hunger, we would stop when we felt full, but we often eat far beyond that.

Emotions and rationalizations within our hidden minds, largely outside of our awareness, drive this type of eating.  This is very important to understand.  One of question that you will be paying very close attention to is this: why am I eating?

For those of us with eating problems, we are usually eating for reasons other than hunger or taste.  That may be hard to believe, but I say this with confidence.  So, if not for hunger, then why are we eating.  That is one of your most critical questions.  Eating because you feel the physical need for sustenance is healthy.  Eating to compensate for exhaustion, stress, feelings of incompleteness or to address other discomforts quickly becomes destructive.

So why then?  The answers can be hidden and complex.  We have a vast sea of emotions and drivers operating outside of our awareness, in our hidden mind.  Awareness is our spotlight into what is happening below.  Gaining insight to the circumstances, emotions, and life stations that lead to unhealthy eating is the a corner stone of your new path.

### Awareness

In order to change, really change, the first step is awareness.  I know that I am being repetitive, but this is a crucial concept to internalize.

What am I eating?  How am I eating?  When am I eating?  Why am I eating.  WHY AM I EATING?  Once you begin to develop awareness around your eating, you will start to have some measure of control.  When you are able to recognize critical eating situations, and the drivers behind them,  you can then develop new ways to talk to yourself when facing them.  Authentic, grounded, informed self talk, flowing from your desire to take care of yourself.  These new ways of thinking about and talking yourself about these problem situations will lead to change.

Not only can you learn to recognize problem situations, you can also learn to manage them.  You can consciously decide to end work at 5pm, no matter how busy you are, to keep your stress and exhaustion levels under control.  You can work on developing healthier sleep habits.  You can start to organize your life to reduce some of emotionally harmful encounters you have with others.  When you learn to manage your discomfort, you will be taking a very important step toward managing your problem eating.  Manage your discomforts.  This is a critical another theme to your heath endeavors.

So, if awareness is so important, how do we develop it?  I will be suggesting that you do two things.  First, weigh yourself every morning and record your weight.  Second, think back to the day prior, write down what you ate.  For eating that you were not happy with, that you feel was unhealthy, think deeply about the situation, and what you were feeling.  Write down your thoughts about what feelings and life circumstances might have lead to the problem eating.  Do the same for eating that you were happy with. This is critical.  This is developing awareness.  The kind of awareness that will lead to change.  As this awareness strengthens, as the fog starts to clear, you will be able to apply thoughtful strategies and self talk to help control unhealthy eating and promote healthy eating.

At first, this may seem like too much work.  It may seem unnatural.  You will likely feel anxiety when you start.  It will be new.  It won’t be part of your established life pattern.  We always feel some level of apprehension when we try something that is not part of our established life patterns.  You will want to get onto other things, to work, the kids, to breakfast.  This anxiety is normal.  If you feel this, ask yourself this: is self care really my most important thing?  It may be hard to say yes at first, but keep focusing on your desire to take care of yourself.  The anxiety will subside, and you can take pride in spending this time on self care.  Within a month or two, the fog will start to clear, you will being to understand your unhealthy patterns, and you start to gain some measure of control over them.  I promise you.

Please believe me when I say this.  Of all the actions I will be suggesting you undertake, daily reflection and writing is this is the most important.  I do this every morning, it usually takes about 15 minutes.
