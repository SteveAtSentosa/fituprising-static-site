### Self Care

What do you wake up in the morning thinking about?  Whatever it might be, it’s a good indicator of what feels most important to you . When was the last time you woke up thinking about taking care of yourself?

You’ve heard it many times, “health is everything”, “you only have one life”, and so on.  You likely say to yourself, yes, I agree.  But do you feel it?  When you think about taking care of yourself, does it feel like poetry . Do you feel it enough that taking care of yourself is your most important thing?

Weight loss is challenge, it eludes 92% of us.  In order to meet this challenge, weight loss and your health will have to become the most important thing to you.  Period.  It will have to be more important than getting the kids to school on time.  More important than finishing a work assignment.  You will have to make self care your driving priority.  The desire for self care is at the foundation of everything.

Some of us don’t have the desire for self care.  In my experience, many people with weight issues have a dislike for themselves at some level, and feel little pull to take care of themselves.  This dislike may be rooted in childhood or other negative life experiences.  This dislike leads to neglect of self, which leads to weight gain and other health problems.  Self judgement from this weight follows, and it fuels the the cycle of self-dislike.  It is a vicious cycle.  To break the cycle you must find within you the desire to take care of yourself.  It all starts with that.

How do you feel about yourself?  Do you think about yourself warmly?  Do you make other’s needs more important than your own?  Some people feel like the don’t deserve care from others or themselves.  Some people even unknowingly sabotage themselves,  because down deep, hidden in their sub-conscious, they don’t feel deserving of care.   A more vibrant life starts with the desire to take care of yourself, but that desire can be hard to find.  It may even take counseling, thats what it took for me.

Think back in your life to when you were a young child.  Visualize this child, the innocence, the good will, the happiness, the need to be cared for.  As you visualize this child, connect to the warm feeling you have.  Do you feel like this child is worth taking care of?  I am guessing that do.  Now, think about the fact that this child is you.  You are certainly deserving of warmth, care and health.  You have been through many life battles since that time.  You may have experienced constant criticism from those that you loved and depended upon.  Your care givers may not have demonstrated with their words or actions that you are were deserving of care.  That is on them, it is a reflection of their own battles.  Unfortunately you are paying the price.  It is time to listen to you now.  You know down deep that you are deserving of care, of warmth, of a good life, no matter what has happened in your past.  Look deep, see if you can find the smallest inkling of desire to take care of your self.  Finding and nurturing this desire is the key to breaking our self destructive cycles.  It is the key successful weight loss and a healthy and vibrant life.  It all starts there.

When you find this desire, hold on to it tight.  Focus on this as you walk through life.  Allow this desire to grow and to drive your actions throughout the day.

### The Most Important Thing

If you feel impatient when you are preparing healthy food in the morning, because you have a critical work assignment hanging over your head, tell yourself that the time spent preparing this food is the most important thing.  Period.  More important than the work assignment.  There is no more important way for you to spend your time.  If you believe this, then the anxiety that you feel will subside, and you will feel good about your efforts to take care of yourself.  You will feel proud of yourself. In 5 years, will the work assignment matter?  Probably not.  In 5 years will your efforts to take care of yourself, and nurture your health matter?  Nothing will be more important to your life.

Your health has to be your most important thing.  You have to be your most important thing.  When you are able to connect with the part of yourself that knows that you are deserving of care and a vibrant life, you will wake up in the morning thinking about how you can take care of yourself that day.  When this happens you will know that you have taken the first step to breaking the cycle.
