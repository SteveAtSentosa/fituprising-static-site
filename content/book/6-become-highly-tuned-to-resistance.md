### Mental Resistance

Sometimes there is something that you feel like you should do.  Perhaps it is something that you feel obligated to do.  Perhaps it is something you are asked to do.  Perhaps it is engaging in healthy behaviors. At the same time, there is often another part of you that does not want to do it.  You may feel that you are too tired, or to busy, or you are angry at the person asking a favor, or you feel overwhelmed by the idea of going to the gym.  You just don’t want to do it.  You know this feeling.  This is mental resistance.

When it comes to health, we can experience mental resistance around taking healthy actions, as well as resistance to avoiding those that are unhealthy. An important part of successful weight loss is getting better at tuning into these feelings and learning when it is best to accept, to challenge, or to pacify them.

You won’t be surprised to hear me say that it starts with **awareness**.  You will work on developing a stronger awareness of the resistance that you feel around healthy behaviors and how to effectively manage this resistance when it conflicts with your health goals.

### Resistance Is Natural

The first step toward managing our resistance is to accept it.  It important to understand that mental resistance is a perfectly normal part of being human.  It helps to guide our behaviors and decisions as we navigate our very complicated life.  But we often want to deny or feel guilty about our resistance.   We feel shame when we are not able to avoid a late night binge. We feel guilt when we just can’t bring ourselves prepare a healthy meal.  We tell ourselves that if we just had enough willpower, we would do the right things.  Awareness and acceptance of resistance is helpful.  Feelings of shame and guild are not.  Please remember the this resistance is part of human nature, it is part of us, it is a part of you.

You will not be waging battle against your mental resistance, that is a war that can not be won. Human nature always wins.  However, you will be learning how to recognize, accept, and manage resistance you feel while seeking to add healthy behaviors to our life.

### We Always Feel Resistance Toward Change

You are looking to change.  You are looking to lose weight.  You are looking to add energy and vibrance to your life.  This means new behaviors and actions.  We  always feel resistance to change, to new behaviors.  Think about what it means to go the gym for the first time.  You have to locate a gym and sign up, you have to find the right clothes, you have choose exercises, you have to figure out how to use the equipment, you worry about looking silly, you worry about being heavier than everybody else, you worry that you will get too exhausted to carry on, you worry that you will be ashamed of your body in the locker room.  It is no wonder that you feel mental resistance.

This may seem like too much to overcome.  I will be writing an entire chapter entitled **Just Take a Step**.  Nike says **Just Do It**, we will be saying **Just Take A Step**.   What if in all of that mess of things above, you tell yourself that all you need to do for now is to purchase workout clothes.  You still may feel resistance to that, but you may be able to overcome that resistance.  If you do end up purchasing t clothes, that will be a major step.  You overcame and removed a small bit of your resistance, and you are building momentum.  You may even find yourself wanting to take the next step, perhaps finding a gym.

### Recognizing Resistance

As part of my daily journaling, I pause, pay attention to, and write down, how I am feeling about staying on track with my planned healthy behaviors that day.  If you take an honest look, you will likely be able to assess how you are feeling.  Part of you may be excited about the progress you are making, part of you may feel good about taking care of yourself, but part of you may be feeling resistance, perhaps significant resistance, to the things that you believe you would like to do for the day.

As part of my daily reflection, I also loosely plan my eating and other healthy activities for the day.   **THIS SECTION INCOMPLETE**
