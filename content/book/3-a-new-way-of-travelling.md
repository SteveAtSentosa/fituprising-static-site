title: A New Way Of Traveling
---

A task ends.  A destination implies finality.  We are not looking for a particular destination.  We are not looking for a map.  We are looking to change the way we travel through life.  The way we travel effects everything.  When self care becomes the most important thing, when seeking health pulls us, when it feels like poetry, we have changed the way we travel.  When this happens, whole new worlds will reveal themselves.

Most weight loss guidance says “Your goal is to lose 30 (or whatever) pounds. if you do A, then B, then C over the next 6 months, you will reach that destination”.   What if you hate doing A?  What if your life circumstances don’t align when it is time for B?  What if you are fed up with the whole process by the time you reach C?

Most of us are not able to do A, then B, then C.  92% of us, to be more exact. Then we tell ourselves, or others tell us, that we did not have enough will power, and we view this as a failure.   Over time we feel hopeless.  The enemy is not your lack of willpower.   The enemy is a prescription that calls for prolonged periods of depravation and unpleasant actives.  That is not aligned with human nature, it is not realistic

What is realistic is finding ways of eating and moving that work for you, that pull you.  What is realistic is taking a break every now and then.  Yes you will be changing the way you eat.  Yes you will change your views about healthy portions.  But you will not be depriving yourself.  You will be adding to your life.  Adding nutrition, adding flavor, adding vigor.  You will be focusing on taking care of yourself and finding what you love.  You will be finding a new way to travel.
