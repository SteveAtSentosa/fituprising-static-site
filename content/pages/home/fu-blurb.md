### My Story

325 pounds. That was my weight 6 years ago.  I am currently 50 pounds lighter.  I have further to go, and there will be ups and downs to be certain. However, after 10 years of working on this, I now feel comfortable that I have discovered, and continue to discover, approaches that are effective for me.  Maybe they can be effective for you as well.

### What Is This Fit Uprising Thing?

Most weight loss guidance says “Your goal is to lose 30 (or whatever) pounds. if you do A, then B, then C over the next 6 months, you will reach that destination”.   What if you hate doing A?  What if your life circumstances don’t align when it is time for B?  What if you are fed up with the whole process by the time you reach C?

These are the types of quesitons that I explore and attempt to answer in these pages.  I'll share what I have learned, along with the approaches that have proven effective for me.  I'll also be exploring new ideas as I continue on my weight loss journey. **It's all about what your mind is doing**.
