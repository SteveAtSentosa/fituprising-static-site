## The Three Axis of Change

The bestselling book "Influencer" studies cases in which significant changes are made by groups and individuals.  The authors discovered that the idea of "over applying" effective approaches is very important.  In chess, there is the notion of prophylaxis, which is the practice of over protecting an important chess piece so that it will continue to be safe if things start to go wrong in the future.  The same idea applies to effecting change, if we can apply multiple change levers, we have a greater chance of success, especially during difficult times.

The book influence identifies 6 change levers, but I have combined and simplified them into the following 3 axis of change:
(1) Psychology
(2) Environment
(3) Social Engagement


## Psychology

We all know what to do in order to lose weight.  Eat less, move more.  There is a plethora of information around eating and exercise, and may plans, that if followed will clearly result in weight loss.  So whats the problem?  The problem is that although most of these "diets" are logistically sound, the are not psychologically sound.  They don't account well for human nature, and in the end human nature always wins.

Instead, it is important to make plans that account for the fact that humans don't do well with sustained deprivation.  Humans don't do well with continually being pushed to do something they don't enjoy.  What is realistic is finding ways of eating and moving that work for you, that pull you. What is realistic is taking a break every now and then.  The is at the core of the fitUprising approach.

In addition working at finding reward in doing small things, like preparing food is important.  You can also focus on monitoring your mental resistance to behaviors that you know further your goals.  Are you rationalizing, is it time to take a small break, or is it time to find a different activity?

Finally, the identity that you have formed for yourself, and the stories that you tell yourself are very important.  If you can start to incorporate into your identity a person that is fit, that enjoys movement, and enjoys a vigorous life, that will go a long way.

## Environment

This boils down to creating an environment that makes it easy to do the things that you want to do.  This applies to both eating and exercise.  Preparing meals ahead of time, especially for busy lunchtimes, is crucial.  We have a strong tendency to do what ever is easiest.  If I don't have a healthy lunch readily available, it is ohh so easy to make a PBJ, or run to the coffee shop for a lunch burrito.  But if I have a nice meal, something that I really enjoy, ready to go, that is the choice that I will make.

Also, having equipment at home that makes it easy for you to work out can be very helpful, make it easy.  If you are going to the gym or pool in the morning, prepare everything the night before so all that you have to do is grab your gym bag and go. If you do, you will be much more likely to do just that.


## Social Engagement

Social engagement can help on many fronts.  First, if you can find others who are trying to make the same changes that you are, there is nothing like a common struggle to lift and motivate the entire group.  You will have a group that you can relate to, that will be sympathetic to your struggles.  And of course the group can also serve as a mechanism for accountability.

The other way that a group can help, is providing suggestions and ideas.  Easy recipes, workouts that they enjoy, ways of thinking about eating problems, etc.

## Conclusion

If you are able to apply these three axis of change to your weight loss endeavor, your chances of success will increase significantly.
