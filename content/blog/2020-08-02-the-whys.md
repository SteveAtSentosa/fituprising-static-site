# The Why's and Why Nots

I believe that it is important to reflect authentically and deeply to identify the reasons that you want to lost weight.  And to not only to identify your reasons, but to internalize them, so that they become a common part of your psyche, belief system and and self talk.

I am starting by putting together 2 lists **I Want** and **I Don't Want.  Every several days I will reflect on each of these, and write a paragraph or two.  My goal is to internalize these reasons.  It's impossible to fake out your psyche, so I have to be authentic.

## I Want

### I want to be able to go on adventures

### I want to feel good physically
### I want to be proud of the way that I look
### I want to bring a vigorous mind, body, and spirit ot the last third of my life
### I want to be proud of my weight loss accomplishment

## I don't Want

### I don't want to just lay on the couch the next 20 years
### I don't want my final years to be a struggle for myself or others
### I don't want to experience a major health crisis in my final years (like stroke or heart attack)
