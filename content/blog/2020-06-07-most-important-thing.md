summary: "Make no mistake, weight loss is an extraordinary challenge.  Never underestimate the vigilance required to lose weight and to keep it off.  It is not impossible obviously, and it can be done in a way that is rewarding. But remember this: if you don’t make weight loss your most important thing, you won’t succeed."
note: "Note: my blog posts take the form of me having a conversation with myself.  I have found that if I am writing for myself rather than others is most effective"

**Dear Steve,**

You are starting with your 8th (or whatever) attempt at weight loss, this day, June 7th 2019.  Of course each time previous you had told yourself that this was the one, this was finally the effort that would lead to the weight that you want. You did lose weight, lots of times, 40 LBS in one stretch, 60 in another.  You learned allot of things during these periods, but because you gained most of it back each time, it is clear that you have additional strategies to uncover and apply.

So, let’s start with this.  You have said this for quite a while now.  When losing weight, it has to be the most important thing.  There are many things that make it difficult to lose weight, for you the most prominent have have been other ambitions taking priority, and emotional entanglements.  Every day, you face many moments where you will be making decisions about how to spend your time, what to eat, how much to eat, when to eat, when to prepare for success, etc.  So, as you go through your daily life, keep this foremost in your awareness as you make your decisions: **This has to be the most important thing**

Let's start by working on keeping this foremost in your mind, and let everything else flow from there.
